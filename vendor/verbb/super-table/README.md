<img width="500" src="https://verbb.io/uploads/plugins/super-table/_800x455_crop_center-center/super-table-social-card.png">

Super Table is a Craft CMS field type to allow you to create powerful tables. You can utilise all your favourite native Craft field types in your tables, including Assets, Users, Entries and even Matrix. Also supports many third-party field types.

## Download

While Craft 3 is still in beta, you'll need to use Composer to download and install the plugin.

1. Open your terminal and go to your Craft project:

        cd /path/to/project

2. Then tell Composer to load the plugin:

        composer require verbb/super-table

3. In the Control Panel, go to Settings → Plugins and click the “Install” button for Super Table.
